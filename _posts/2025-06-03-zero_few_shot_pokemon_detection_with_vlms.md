Building an AI system for image or video understanding typically requires large labeled datasets and extensive training. However, in many real-world scenarios:

- Labeled data is unavailable or expensive.
- Training or fine-tuning is resource-intensive.
- The task involves many categories and must generalize easily.

This project explores how to build a practical visual recognition pipeline using vision-language models (VLMs) and zero- or few-shot learning ‚Äî without manual labeling or retraining.

**Pok√©mon detection** is used as the case study: a multi-class visual task with limited supervision, showcasing scalable and flexible recognition using modern multimodal AI models.

## üß† Zero-Shot Classification with CLIP

The first step uses [OpenAI's CLIP model](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) to classify video frames without any training. CLIP belongs to the family of vision-language models that jointly process images and natural language to enable cross-modal understanding.

It uses a dual-encoder architecture ‚Äî one for images and one for text ‚Äî trained to align paired image-caption data in a shared embedding space.

For each frame, the model computes an image embedding and compares it to embeddings of class names like `"Pikachu"` or `"Charmander"`. The class with the highest cosine similarity score is selected as the prediction.

- No training or fine-tuning is required.
- Multiple class prompts can be evaluated in a single pass.
- Class similarity scores provide confidence indicators.

This approach demonstrates how a pretrained vision-language model can perform visual classification in a flexible, open-ended setting using only descriptive text prompts.

A short Pok√©mon intro video (~1 minute) was sourced from [Archive.org](https://archive.org) and used as the test video throughout this project.

### üìä Observations from Zero-Shot Classification

The example below shows CLIP's predictions across selected frames from the test video.

- In the top two rows, the model correctly identifies the visible Pok√©mon using zero-shot classification.
- The model is limited to a single prediction per frame, even when multiple Pok√©mon are clearly present.
- In the final row, where no prompted Pok√©mon appear, CLIP produces incorrect guesses‚Äîoften influenced by dominant colors (e.g., blue areas predicted as Squirtle, red/orange as Charmander).

## üß™ Few-Shot Classification with CLIP Prototypes

To go beyond zero-shot limitations, we adopt a **few-shot classification** strategy using a labeled Pok√©mon dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification), containing ~50 images per class.

- üìÅ The dataset was uploaded to Google Drive for easy access within the notebook.
- üéØ A subset of Pok√©mon classes was selected‚Äîfocused on characters visible in the test video.
- üß† For each class, **CLIP embeddings** are computed and averaged to create a class-level **prototype**.
- üÜö During inference, new video frames are classified by comparing their embeddings to these prototypes using **cosine similarity**.

This method improves prediction accuracy while requiring only a handful of labeled examples per class.

### üìä Observations from Few-Shot Classification

- The model successfully classifies a wide variety of Pok√©mon with high confidence (e.g., Mew, Pikachu, Squirtle, Pidgeotto).
- It struggles when no Pok√©mon is present in the frame‚Äîfalse positives occur due to background or scene context.
- Non-Pok√©mon elements like people or Pok√©balls sometimes trigger incorrect predictions.
- The confidence threshold can be adjusted to filter out low-certainty predictions and reduce noise in such edge cases.

## üîÅ Dataset Expansion via Web Search

While the few-shot classifier performs well on Pok√©mon seen during prototype construction, it struggles with **unseen objects** such as Ash or a Pok√©ball, which are not part of the initial support set.

To address this limitation:

- üåê Publicly available images can be retrieved for new categories.
- üì∏ This method allows for low-effort dataset expansion without manual labeling.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The quality and relevance of the results depend heavily on curation.

This approach highlights a practical way to improve recognition performance in zero- or few-shot settings by closing key data gaps.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations for Dataset Expansion

- Retrieved images often include unrelated elements (e.g., Ash alongside other characters), which may confuse the model.
- Matching the visual style, resolution, and framing of the test data is important to reduce domain shift and ensure consistency.

## üïµÔ∏è Zero-Shot Object Detection with Grounding DINO

This step introduces [Grounding DINO](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base) (`IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base`), a vision-language model designed for **zero-shot object detection** using natural language prompts. Unlike classification, which assigns a single label to an image or frame, object detection also identifies where the objects are by drawing bounding boxes around them.

Grounding DINO belongs to a newer class of multimodal models that tightly integrate vision and language. It uses a transformer-based architecture to predict object regions conditioned on free-form text input.

- üìù Prompts like `"a Pok√©mon"` or specific names guide the model.
- üéØ The model outputs bounding boxes for objects that match the prompt.
- üîç Detection is flexible and open-ended ‚Äî no fixed class vocabulary or retraining is required.

This makes Grounding DINO well-suited for detecting multiple objects in dynamic scenes, directly from descriptive text. It enables general-purpose object localization without supervision, bridging visual and linguistic domains effectively.

**‚úèÔ∏è Prompt Sensitivity in Grounding DINO**

The choice of prompt can significantly influence detection performance:

- üß† A general prompt like `"pokemon"` results in **higher confidence** and tighter bounding boxes.
- üßæ Listing specific classes (e.g., `"squirtle, charmander, bulbasaur"`) may yield correct detections, but with **lower confidence** or less optimal localization.
- üéØ This highlights Grounding DINO‚Äôs sensitivity to prompt wording‚Äî**phrasing matters** in zero-shot detection tasks.

![Zero-shot detection of Squirtle using Grounding DINO.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitrisdais/dimitris-dais.github.io/master/assets/img/zero_shot_object_detection_with_grounding_dino_squirtle.png)

**üë• Adding 'Person' to the Prompt**

- When no Pok√©mon are present but a person is visible, adding `"person"` to the prompt helps guide the model.
- üß≠ This improves relevance by reducing false positives and enabling more accurate detections.
- üìå In this example, the original prompt predicts a Pok√©mon; the updated prompt correctly identifies a person instead.

![Zero-shot detection of Ash and Pok√©mon using Grounding DINO.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitrisdais/dimitris-dais.github.io/master/assets/img/zero_shot_object_detection_with_grounding_dino_ash.png)

- The model correctly detects a variety of Pok√©mon (e.g., Squirtle, Rapidash, Lapras) and occasionally persons (e.g., Ash, Team Rocket) when the "person" class is included in the prompt.
- It handles multi-object scenes reasonably well, identifying multiple characters in the same frame in some cases.
- However, it still struggles in crowded scenes‚Äîoften missing one or more objects when both Pok√©mon and people appear together.
- The model also confuses Pok√©balls with Pok√©mon, even when "pokeball" is explicitly included in the prompt.
- Some bounding boxes are imprecise or attached to the wrong object, especially when characters are occluded or small.

## üß≠ Zero-Shot Object Detection with OWLv2

This step introduces [OWLv2](https://huggingface.co/google/owlv2-large-patch14-ensemble) (`google/owlv2-large-patch14-ensemble`), a vision-language model designed for **open-vocabulary object detection** using natural language prompts. OWLv2 improves upon earlier models like Grounding DINO by offering stronger generalization and more robust object localization.

OWLv2 belongs to the family of transformer-based vision-language models trained on image-text pairs with a focus on detection tasks. It leverages a unified architecture to understand both images and free-form textual queries and localize relevant objects in a zero-shot setting.

- üîç Uses a powerful visual backbone and multi-scale features for higher precision.
- üåê Trained on a broad set of vision-language data for better open-domain generalization.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Less sensitive to the exact wording of prompts compared to Grounding DINO.
- üéØ Supports detection of multiple, diverse objects in complex scenes without fine-tuning.

OWLv2 demonstrates how modern detection models can be guided entirely by text to identify and locate objects with high accuracy ‚Äî even in cluttered or unseen scenarios.

### üìä Observations from Zero-Shot Object Detection with OWLv2

The OWLv2 model delivers robust results across diverse Pok√©mon frames using the prompt:  
`["a pokemon", "a person", "a pokeball"]`

- ‚úÖ **Stronger performance** than Grounding DINO, with more accurate box placements and reduced false positives.
- üß† Successfully detects objects like **Pok√©balls**, which were previously missed or misclassified.
- üîç Overlapping boxes or redundant detections could be filtered using **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** for cleaner results.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Further refinement is possible by tuning the **minimum score threshold** to filter out lower-confidence predictions.
- üí° Overall, OWLv2 offers a **powerful zero-shot detection solution**‚Äîno custom training, yet it generalizes impressively across the Pok√©mon universe.

## ‚úÖ Conclusions

This project demonstrated how to build a zero- and few-shot Pok√©mon recognition system using modern vision-language models ‚Äî all without any model fine-tuning.

- **CLIP** was used for image-level classification, both in zero-shot and few-shot configurations.
- **Grounding DINO** enabled flexible, prompt-based object detection without predefined labels.
- **OWLv2** improved detection accuracy and robustness across complex scenes and diverse objects.

Each model served a specific role in the pipeline ‚Äî showcasing how different AI components can be chained together to solve real-world problems under data-scarce conditions.

For further improvement:  

- Detected bounding boxes from OWLv2 could be passed to the **few-shot CLIP classifier** to assign more accurate Pok√©mon labels per object.
- Alternatively, a **multimodal large language model (MLLM)** like **Qwen-VL** or **Mistral** could process the cropped detections and reason about the characters visually and linguistically.
- Applying **post-filtering**, **box refinement**, or even **temporal smoothing** could further stabilize the results across video frames.

No single model does it all. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each tool ‚Äî and how they can complement each other ‚Äî is key to designing AI systems that are practical, flexible, and effective. Multimodal AI is not just about having powerful models, but about making them work together seamlessly.
